# Debugging Log: NYC Voucher Navigator

## 🎉 LATEST FIXES (December 2024) - Smolagents 1.19, URL Validation & Address Extraction

### Bug 10: Smolagents 1.19 Code Parsing Issues - RESOLVED ✅

#### Description
- After upgrading to Smolagents 1.19, agents were hitting max steps (42) without executing tools
- Error: `regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found`  
- Agent responses were in `````python` format but Smolagents expected `<code>` format
- School and subway queries that previously took 1-2 steps were timing out

#### Root Cause Analysis
Smolagents 1.19 introduced stricter code parsing that only accepted `<code>` tags, but the LLM (Gemini) was outputting Python code blocks in `````python` format. The parsing functions `parse_code_blobs` and `extract_code_from_text` couldn't handle this mismatch.

#### Investigation Process
1. **Manual Testing**: User tested school query, agent hit max steps instead of executing tools
2. **Log Analysis**: Found `regex pattern <code>(.*?)</code> was not found` errors
3. **LLM Response Analysis**: Gemini outputting `````python` but Smolagents expecting `<code>`
4. **Version Comparison**: Issue didn't exist in previous Smolagents versions

#### Successful Fix ✅
**Created `final_fix.py` with monkey patches**:
```python
def enhanced_parse_code_blobs(text):
    # Handle both <code> and ```python formats
    code_pattern = r'<code>(.*?)</code>'
    python_pattern = r'```python\s*(.*?)\s*```'
    
    codes = re.findall(code_pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
    if codes:
        return [code.strip() for code in codes]
    
    # Fallback to python code blocks
    codes = re.findall(python_pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
    return [code.strip() for code in codes] if codes else []

def enhanced_extract_code_from_text(text):
    # Try both formats and return first valid match
    for pattern in [r'<code>(.*?)</code>', r'```python\s*(.*?)\s*```']:
        match = re.search(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            return match.group(1).strip()
    return None
```

**Applied to `app.py`**:
```python
from final_fix import apply_final_fix
apply_final_fix()
```

#### Testing Results
- ✅ **School Query**: Now executes in 1-2 steps instead of 42
- ✅ **Tool Execution**: Proper geocoding and school finding functionality
- ✅ **Code Parsing**: Handles both `<code>` and `````python` formats
- ✅ **Performance**: Fast agent responses restored

---

### Bug 11: Cross-Region Listing Contamination - RESOLVED ✅

#### Description
- NYC search results included Newark, NJ listings mislabeled as Bronx, NY
- Example: `https://newjersey.craigslist.org/apa/d/newark-section-welcome-modern-bed-unit/7861491771.html`
- Address "689 Sanford Ave, Newark, NJ 07029" was being shown as "689 Sanford Ave, Bronx, NY"
- Geocoding failed because the address doesn't exist in Bronx
- School/subway queries failed for these contaminated listings

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Search Contamination**: Browser agent searches NYC boroughs correctly but somehow NJ listings get included
2. **Address Normalization Issue**: When no NYC borough detected, logic automatically adds "Bronx" context
3. **No URL Validation**: System processed any Craigslist URL without verifying it's actually in NYC

#### Investigation Process
1. **Manual Testing**: User found Listing #5 (689 Sanford Ave) failed school/subway queries
2. **URL Analysis**: Discovered the link was actually `newjersey.craigslist.org`
3. **Address Extraction Debug**: Found "689 Sanford Ave" extracted correctly
4. **Normalization Logic**: Found automatic "Bronx" addition when no borough detected

#### Successful Fix ✅
**Created `browser_agent_fix.py` with URL validation**:
```python
def validate_listing_url_for_nyc(url):
    """Validate that a listing URL is actually for NYC"""
    if not url or 'craigslist.org' not in url:
        return False, "Not a Craigslist URL"
    
    # Block non-NYC domains
    non_nyc_domains = ['newjersey.craigslist.org', 'longisland.craigslist.org', 
                       'westernmass.craigslist.org', 'hudsonvalley.craigslist.org']
    for domain in non_nyc_domains:
        if domain in url:
            return False, f"Non-NYC domain detected: {domain}"
    
    # Ensure it's NYC
    if 'newyork.craigslist.org' not in url:
        return False, "Not a NYC Craigslist URL"
    
    # Validate borough codes
    valid_borough_codes = ['/brx/', '/bro/', '/que/', '/mnh/', '/stn/']
    if not any(code in url for code in valid_borough_codes):
        return False, "Invalid or missing NYC borough code"
    
    return True, "Valid NYC listing"
```

**Updated `browser_agent.py`** to validate URLs before processing:
```python
# Validate each listing URL
is_valid, reason = validate_listing_url_for_nyc(listing_url)
if not is_valid:
    print(f"⚠️ Skipping invalid listing: {reason}")
    continue
```

#### Testing Results
- ✅ **Cross-Region Filtering**: Newark, NJ listings now blocked
- ✅ **Address Accuracy**: Only valid NYC addresses processed
- ✅ **Tool Success**: School/subway queries work for all validated listings
- ✅ **Quality Control**: Improved listing quality and user experience

---

### Bug 12: Address Extraction Showing Title Text Instead of Addresses - RESOLVED ✅

#### Description
- App displayed "Address: 3 BEDROOM / NEWLY RENOVATED (ALL BRONX, NY" instead of actual address
- User clicked actual Craigslist link and saw "East 195th Street" under OpenStreet map
- Address extraction was picking up title/description text instead of real location data
- Previous extraction logic prioritized intersection descriptions over complete addresses

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Title Contamination**: Extraction was picking up listing titles as addresses
2. **Missing Real Sources**: Not properly checking `.mapaddress` elements or JSON structured data
3. **Poor Scoring**: Title-like content was scoring higher than actual address sources
4. **Strategy Priority**: Complex scoring system was backfiring and selecting wrong content

#### Investigation Process
1. **Manual URL Testing**: User found "East 195th Street" visible on actual Craigslist page
2. **Debug Specific Listing**: Found `.mapaddress` contained "East 195th Street"
3. **JSON Data Discovery**: Found structured data with complete address information
4. **Extraction Analysis**: Previous logic was contaminated by title text patterns

#### Successful Fix ✅
**Created `fixed_address_extraction.py` with improved prioritization**:
```javascript
// Prioritize reliable sources with source bonuses
let sources = [
    { elements: document.querySelectorAll('.mapaddress'), bonus: 4, name: 'mapaddress' },
    { elements: document.querySelectorAll('[itemprop="streetAddress"]'), bonus: 3, name: 'itemprop' },
    { elements: document.querySelectorAll('.address'), bonus: 2, name: 'address-class' },
    { elements: document.querySelectorAll('span:contains("address"), div:contains("address")'), bonus: 1, name: 'contains-address' }
];

// Extract JSON structured data
let scripts = document.querySelectorAll('script[type="application/ld+json"]');
scripts.forEach(script => {
    try {
        let data = JSON.parse(script.textContent);
        if (data.streetAddress || data.address?.streetAddress) {
            let address = data.streetAddress || data.address.streetAddress;
            candidates.push({
                text: address,
                quality: 10, // High quality for structured data
                source: 'json-ld',
                sourceBonus: 5 // High source bonus
            });
        }
    } catch (e) {}
});

// Heavily penalize title-like content
if (isLikelyTitle(text)) {
    quality -= 15; // Severe penalty for titles
}
```

**Applied to `app.py`**:
```python
from fixed_address_extraction import apply_address_extraction_fix
apply_address_extraction_fix()
```

#### Testing Results  
- ✅ **Proper Address Display**: Shows "East 195th Street, Bronx, NY 10458"
- ✅ **Source Prioritization**: `.mapaddress` and JSON data prioritized over titles
- ✅ **Title Filtering**: Listing titles no longer contaminate address extraction
- ✅ **Complete Information**: Structured data provides full address with zip codes

#### Final App State
All three fixes applied and working:
1. **Smolagents 1.19 Fix**: Fast agent execution (1-2 steps vs 42+)
2. **URL Validation**: Blocks cross-region contamination  
3. **Address Extraction**: Prioritizes reliable sources, avoids title contamination

## 🌍 MULTILINGUAL IMPLEMENTATION (December 2024) - COMPLETED ✅

### Enhancement: Comprehensive Multilingual Support for Navi

#### Description
Implemented full multilingual support for Navi's introduction message and conversation flow, supporting NYC's diverse population. The system now automatically detects user language and maintains conversation continuity in the detected/selected language.

#### Requirements Implemented
1. **Multilingual Introduction Messages**: Navi greets users in their preferred language
2. **Language Detection**: Automatically detect language from user messages
3. **Dynamic Language Switching**: Switch language via dropdown OR automatic detection
4. **Conversation Continuity**: Maintain selected language throughout the interaction
5. **Cultural Adaptation**: Proper localization for each language community

#### Implementation Details

**Supported Languages (4 Total):**
- 🇺🇸 **English (en)**: Default language with comprehensive greeting
- 🇪🇸 **Spanish (es)**: "¡Hola! Soy Navi, tu Navegadora Personal de Vivienda de NYC!"
- 🇨🇳 **Chinese (zh)**: "您好！我是Navi，您的个人纽约市住房导航员！"
- 🇧🇩 **Bengali (bn)**: "নমস্কার! আমি নবি, আপনার ব্যক্তিগত NYC হাউজিং নেভিগেটর!"

**Technical Architecture:**

**1. Internationalization Setup (app.py)**:
```python
i18n_dict = {
    "en": {
        "intro_greeting": """👋 **Hi there! I'm Navi, your personal NYC Housing Navigator!**
        
I'm here to help you find safe, affordable, and voucher-friendly housing in New York City...
        """,
        # 46 total keys for complete UI translation
    },
    "es": {
        "intro_greeting": """👋 **¡Hola! Soy Navi, tu Navegadora Personal de Vivienda de NYC!**
        
Estoy aquí para ayudarte a encontrar vivienda segura, asequible y que acepta vouchers...
        """,
        # Complete Spanish translation
    },
    # Chinese and Bengali versions...
}
```

**2. Language Detection Function**:
```python
def detect_language_from_message(message: str) -> str:
    """Detect language from user message using keyword matching."""
    message_lower = message.lower()
    
    # Spanish keywords
    spanish_keywords = [
        'hola', 'apartamento', 'vivienda', 'casa', 'alquiler', 'renta', 'busco', 
        'necesito', 'ayuda', 'donde', 'como', 'que', 'soy', 'tengo', 'quiero',
        'habitacion', 'habitaciones', 'dormitorio', 'precio', 'costo', 'dinero',
        'section', 'cityFHEPS', 'voucher', 'bronx', 'brooklyn', 'manhattan',
        'queens', 'gracias', 'por favor', 'dime', 'dame', 'encuentro'
    ]
    
    # Chinese keywords (simplified)
    chinese_keywords = [
        '你好', '公寓', '住房', '房屋', '租金', '寻找', '需要', '帮助', '在哪里',
        '怎么', '什么', '我', '有', '要', '房间', '卧室', '价格', '钱',
        '住房券', '布朗克斯', '布鲁克林', '曼哈顿', '皇后区', '谢谢', '请',
        '告诉', '给我', '找到'
    ]
    
    # Bengali keywords
    bengali_keywords = [
        'নমস্কার', 'অ্যাপার্টমেন্ট', 'বাড়ি', 'ভাড়া', 'খুঁজছি', 'প্রয়োজন',
        'সাহায্য', 'কোথায়', 'কিভাবে', 'কি', 'আমি', 'আছে', 'চাই',
        'রুম', 'বেডরুম', 'দাম', 'টাকা', 'ভাউচার', 'ব্রঙ্কস', 'ব্রুকলিন',
        'ম্যানহাটান', 'কুইন্স', 'ধন্যবাদ', 'দয়া করে', 'বলুন', 'দিন', 'খুঁজে'
    ]
    
    # Count matches and return language with highest score (minimum 2 matches)
    spanish_count = sum(1 for keyword in spanish_keywords if keyword in message_lower)
    chinese_count = sum(1 for keyword in chinese_keywords if keyword in message)
    bengali_count = sum(1 for keyword in bengali_keywords if keyword in message)
    
    if spanish_count >= 2:
        return "es"
    elif chinese_count >= 2:
        return "zh"
    elif bengali_count >= 2:
        return "bn"
    else:
        return "en"  # Default to English
```

**3. Dynamic Greeting Generation**:
```python
def create_initial_greeting(language="en"):
    greeting_message = {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": i18n_dict[language]["intro_greeting"]
    }
    return [greeting_message]
```

**4. Language-Aware Chat Handler**:
```python
def handle_chat_message(message: str, history: list, current_state: Dict, strict_mode: bool):
    # Detect language from user message
    detected_language = detect_language_from_message(message)
    current_language = current_state.get("preferences", {}).get("language", "en")
    
    # Check if language has changed
    language_changed = False
    if detected_language != current_language and detected_language != "en":
        current_language = detected_language
        language_changed = True
        print(f"🌍 Language detected: {detected_language}")
    
    # Update state with detected language
    new_state = update_app_state(current_state, {
        "preferences": {
            "strict_mode": strict_mode,
            "language": current_language
        }
    })
    
    # Update greeting if language changed
    if language_changed and len(history) > 1:
        for i, msg in enumerate(history):
            if msg["role"] == "assistant" and any(name in msg["content"] for name in ["I'm Navi", "Soy Navi", "我是Navi", "আমি নবি"]):
                new_greeting = create_initial_greeting(current_language)
                history[i] = new_greeting[0]
                break
```

**5. Language-Aware Agent Responses**:
```python
def handle_general_conversation(message: str, history: list, state: Dict):
    # Get current language from state
    current_language = state.get("preferences", {}).get("language", "en")
    
    # Add language context to agent message
    language_context = f"""
IMPORTANT: The user's preferred language is '{current_language}'. Please respond in this language:
- en = English
- es = Spanish  
- zh = Chinese (Simplified)
- bn = Bengali

User message: {enhanced_message}
    """.strip()
    
    agent_output = caseworker_agent.run(language_context, reset=False)
```

**6. Dropdown Language Switching**:
```python
def change_language(language, current_state, current_history):
    """Handle language change with greeting update."""
    # Update the language in state
    new_state = update_app_state(current_state, {
        "preferences": {"language": language}
    })
    
    # Create new greeting in the selected language
    new_greeting = create_initial_greeting(language)
    
    # Replace the first message (greeting) if it exists
    if current_history and len(current_history) > 0 and current_history[0]["role"] == "assistant":
        updated_history = [new_greeting[0]] + current_history[1:]
    else:
        updated_history = new_greeting + current_history
    
    return updated_history, new_state

# Connect to language dropdown
language_dropdown.change(
    change_language,
    [language_dropdown, app_state, chatbot],
    [chatbot, app_state]
)
```

### Bug 7: Location Change Requests Not Working - RESOLVED ✅

#### Description
- Users asking "How about Brooklyn?" after searching in the Bronx were getting general conversation responses instead of new searches
- The agent would respond with "I can help with that!" instead of triggering a new search

#### Root Cause Analysis
The `enhanced_classify_message` function in `email_handler.py` was checking listing questions BEFORE new search patterns:
1. **"what about"** was included in listing question patterns
2. When "How about Brooklyn?" was processed, it matched listing question logic first
3. Since no listings were present in context, it returned `general_conversation`
4. The new search patterns never got checked

#### Investigation Process
1. **Tested Classification**: "How about Brooklyn?" → `general_conversation` ❌
2. **Analyzed Pattern Order**: Found listing questions checked before new search
3. **Identified Conflict**: "what about" existed in both pattern sets
4. **Traced Logic Flow**: Listing logic was catching location changes first

#### Failed Attempts
1. **Enhanced LLM Fallback**: Improved the fallback router but didn't fix core classification
2. **Additional Patterns**: Added more location change patterns but order issue remained

#### Successful Fix ✅
1. **Reordered Classification Logic**: Moved new search detection BEFORE listing question detection
2. **Enhanced Location Patterns**: Added comprehensive patterns:
   ```python
   ["how about in", "what about in", "try in", "look in", "search in", "find in", "check in", "instead in"]
   ["how about", "what about", "try", "instead"]  # when combined with borough mentions
   ["Can I see"]  # for housing searches
   ```
3. **Removed Conflicts**: Removed "what about" from listing question patterns
4. **Testing Results**: 11/11 location change tests now pass (100% success rate)

---

### Bug 8: Browser Agent Returning 0 Listings - RESOLVED ✅

#### Description  
- Browser agent was successfully finding search interface but extracting 0 listings
- User reported existing listings: https://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/apa/d/bronx-section-2-bedroom-newly-renovated/7857996609.html
- Search was completing in 2.5-3.4 seconds but finding no results

#### Investigation Process

**Phase 1: Search Interface Issue (Initially Suspected)**
- Suspected "Could not find search interface" errors
- Found Craigslist changed from `#query` to `input[placeholder*="search apartments"]`
- ✅ Fixed search selectors, but 0 listings issue persisted

**Phase 2: Complex Search Query Issue** 
- Tested standalone JavaScript extraction with same complex query: `"Section 8 OR CityFHEPS OR voucher"`
- Found that complex OR queries don't work well with Craigslist
- ✅ Simplified to just `"Section 8"` - standalone test found 9 listings including target

**Phase 3: View Mode Mismatch Issue**
- Compared URLs:
  - **Working standalone**: `https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/brx/apa?format=list` → Gallery mode (63 gallery cards)
  - **Browser agent**: `https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/brx/apa?query=Section%208#search=2~grid~0` → Grid mode (0 gallery cards, 60 posting titles)
- Browser agent was in grid mode but JavaScript only handled gallery mode

#### Root Cause
1. **Query Complexity**: Complex `"Section 8 OR CityFHEPS OR voucher"` query failed on Craigslist
2. **View Mode Mismatch**: Browser agent ended up in grid mode while JavaScript expected gallery mode
3. **JavaScript Selector Issue**: Extraction script looked for `.gallery-card` elements that don't exist in grid mode

#### Failed Attempts
1. **Search Interface Fixes**: Updated selectors but didn't fix extraction
2. **Console Log Removal**: Cleaned up JavaScript but didn't address mode issue  
3. **Validation Bypass**: Confirmed extraction was the issue, not validation pipeline

#### Successful Fix ✅

**1. Simplified Search Query**:
```python
# Before: query: str = '"SECTION-8" OR "SECTION 8" OR "ALL SECTION 8" OR "CITYFHEPS"'
# After:  query: str = "Section 8"
```

**2. Updated JavaScript for Both Gallery and Grid Mode**:
```javascript
// Try gallery mode first (like our working test)  
let galleryCards = document.querySelectorAll('.gallery-card');
if (galleryCards.length > 0) {
    // GALLERY MODE - handle .gallery-card elements
    // ... existing gallery logic
} else {
    // GRID MODE - work with posting-title links directly
    let postingTitles = document.querySelectorAll('a.posting-title');
    // ... new grid mode logic
}
```

**3. Results**:
- ✅ **60 listings extracted** (vs 0 before)
- ✅ **Target listing found**: "SECTION-8 2 BEDROOM/NEWLY RENOVATED" (7857996609.html)
- ✅ **56 listings passed validation** and include addresses, prices, voucher indicators

#### Testing Results
- **Location Change Classification**: 11/11 tests passed (100%)
- **Browser Agent Extraction**: 60 listings extracted, 56 validated
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Complete success with real Section 8 listings

#### Files Modified
- `browser_agent.py`: Updated default query and JavaScript extraction logic
- `app.py`: Changed default search query to simple "Section 8"
- `email_handler.py`: Fixed classification order and enhanced patterns

### Bug 9: Nearest Subway Tool Not Working - RESOLVED ✅

#### Description
- The `NearestSubwayTool` was failing when called through the smolagents CodeAgent framework
- Direct tool calls worked perfectly, but integration with the agent resulted in AttributeError
- Error: `'NearestSubwayTool' object has no attribute 'is_initialized'`
- This affected all location-based queries and enrichment functionality

#### Root Cause Analysis
The smolagents framework internally checks for an `is_initialized` attribute on Tool objects during execution, but this wasn't documented in the Tool interface. Our custom tools inherited from `smolagents.Tool` but didn't have this expected framework attribute.

#### Investigation Process
1. **Direct Tool Testing**: Confirmed tools work independently:
   ```python
   geocode_result = geocoding_tool.forward('Grand Avenue, Bronx, NY 10468')
   # ✅ Success: (40.8662227, -73.9006796)
   
   subway_result = nearest_subway_tool.forward(lat=40.8662227, lon=-73.9006796) 
   # ✅ Success: Kingsbridge Rd (4 train) - 0.2 miles
   ```

2. **Agent Integration Failure**: Same tools failed when called through CodeAgent:
   ```
   Code execution failed at line 'geocode_result = geocode_address(address=address)' 
   due to: AttributeError: 'GeocodingTool' object has no attribute 'is_initialized'
   ```

3. **Framework Analysis**: Found smolagents expects undocumented `is_initialized` attribute

#### Failed Attempts
1. **Expanded Authorized Imports**: Added missing imports like `time`, `datetime`, `typing`, etc.
   - Didn't resolve the core framework issue
2. **Tool Validation Functions**: Created validation functions to check tool attributes
   - All tools passed validation but still failed in agent context
3. **Alternative Tool Registration**: Tried different ways to register tools
   - Framework issue persisted regardless of registration method

#### Successful Fix ✅

**1. Added Proper Tool Base Class Initialization**:
```python
def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()  # ← Added this to properly initialize Tool base class
    # ... existing initialization
```

**2. Added Missing Framework Attribute**:
```python
def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    # ... existing setup ...
    self.is_initialized = True  # ← Added this expected attribute
```

**3. Files Modified**:
- ✅ `nearest_subway_tool.py` - Added `super().__init__()` and `is_initialized = True`
- ✅ `geocoding_tool.py` - Added `super().__init__()` and `is_initialized = True`  
- ✅ `enrichment_tool.py` - Added `super().__init__()` and `is_initialized = True`
- ✅ `violation_checker_agent.py` - Added `super().__init__()` and `is_initialized = True`
- ✅ `browser_agent.py` - Already had proper initialization
- ✅ `agent_setup.py` - Expanded authorized imports for tool compatibility

#### Testing Results

**Before Fix**:
```
❌ AttributeError: 'GeocodingTool' object has no attribute 'is_initialized'
❌ Tools work individually but fail in agent context
❌ No subway proximity information available to users
```

**After Fix** ✅:
```
🌍 Geocoding address: Grand Avenue, Bronx NY 10468
✅ Geocoded: Grand Avenue, Bronx NY 10468 → (40.8662227, -73.9006796)

🚇 Found: Kingsbridge Rd (0.2 miles)

The nearest subway station to Grand Avenue, Bronx NY 10468 is **Kingsbridge Rd** (4 train) - approximately 0.2 miles away.
```

#### Key Technical Improvements
1. **Framework Compatibility**: All tools now properly inherit from smolagents.Tool
2. **Robust Initialization**: Proper `super().__init__()` calls ensure base class setup
3. **Expected Attributes**: Added `is_initialized` flag that framework expects
4. **NYC Open Data Integration**: Real-time subway data from 2000+ stations
5. **Intelligent Caching**: 24-hour cache with background cleanup for performance
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Works across all NYC boroughs

#### User Experience Enhancement

## Bug 1: Incorrect Prompt Template Structure

### Description
- The application failed to start due to issues with the `prompt_templates` argument for `CodeAgent` in `agent_setup.py`.
- Error messages indicated missing keys (like `initial_plan`) or incorrect types (e.g., passing a dictionary instead of a string for `system_prompt`).

### Attempts
1. **Dictionary-Based Prompt Templates:**
   - Initially tried passing a nested dictionary for `prompt_templates`, but this led to assertion errors and type errors.

2. **Consulted Documentation:**
   - Documentation confirmed that `prompt_templates` must be an instance of the `PromptTemplates` class, with nested class instances for `planning`, `managed_agent`, and `final_answer`.

3. **Class-Based Refactor:**
   - Updated `agent_setup.py` to use the correct class-based structure, initializing `PromptTemplates` and its nested classes with all required keys, including the missing `initial_plan` for `PlanningPromptTemplate`.

### Fix
- **Switching to the Class-Based PromptTemplates Structure:**
  - Once we used the correct class-based approach (with all required keys), the agent initialized successfully.

## Bug 2: Missing Dependencies

### Description
- The application failed due to missing dependencies required by the base tools.

### Attempts
- Installed missing dependencies (like `duckduckgo-search`) as required by the base tools.

### Fix
- Installing `duckduckgo-search` resolved earlier import errors related to base tools.

## Bug 3: NameError for 'gr' in app.py

### Description
- After successful agent initialization, running the app results in:
  ```
  NameError: name 'gr' is not defined
  ```
- This error occurs at the line where `gr.Blocks` is used in `app.py`, even though `import gradio as gr` is present at the top of the file.

### Attempts
- Confirmed that the correct file is being run and the import is present.
- Verified that Gradio is installed and importable in the environment (version 5.33.1).

### Potential Solutions (Based on NotebookLM Information)

1. **Environment and Installation Checks:**
   - Verify Python version is 3.10 or higher (required by Gradio)
   - Ensure Gradio is installed with all necessary extras:
     ```bash
     pip install "gradio[mcp]"  # For MCP support
     pip install "gradio[toolkit]"  # For additional tools
     ```

2. **Virtual Environment Verification:**
   - Confirm we're running in the correct virtual environment
   - Check if Gradio is installed in the active environment
   - Verify no conflicting installations exist

3. **Code Execution Context:**
   - Try running the app using Gradio's hot-reload mode:
     ```bash
     gradio app.py
     ```
   - This might provide better error messages and automatic reloading

4. **Debug Mode:**
   - Enable Gradio's debug mode by setting:
     ```bash
     export GRADIO_DEBUG=1
     ```
   - This prevents immediate termination on errors and provides more detailed output

5. **File Path and Access:**
   - Ensure the application is run from the correct directory
   - Check if any file path restrictions are in place
   - Verify all necessary files are accessible

6. **Cache and Bytecode:**
   - Clear Python bytecode cache:
     ```bash
     find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
     find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -r {} +
     ```

7. **Component Initialization:**
   - Wrap heavy initialization code in `if gr.NO_RELOAD:` block
   - This prevents issues with repeated reloading of C/Rust extensions

### Next Steps
1. Try running the app with Gradio's hot-reload mode
2. Enable debug mode for more detailed error messages
3. Clear Python bytecode cache
4. Verify Python version and Gradio installation
5. Check virtual environment activation

Would you like to proceed with any of these potential solutions? 

## Bug 4: Gradio Chatbot Parameter Error

### Description
- After resolving agent initialization, running the app resulted in:
  ```
  TypeError: Chatbot.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'bubble_fill'
  ```
- This error was due to the use of the now-unsupported `bubble_fill` parameter in the Gradio `Chatbot` component.

### Attempts
1. **Remove Unsupported Parameter:**
   - Removed `bubble_fill=False` from the `Chatbot` initialization in `app.py`.
2. **Tested App:**
   - The app started successfully, but a deprecation warning appeared regarding the default message format for the chatbot.

### Fix
- **Switch to OpenAI-Style Messages:**
  - Updated the `Chatbot` initialization to use `type="messages"`.
  - This removed the warning and ensured future compatibility with Gradio.

### Solution That Worked
- The final working line:
  ```python
  chatbot = gr.Chatbot(label="Conversation with VoucherBot", height=600, type="messages")
  ```
- The app now runs without errors or warnings, and the UI works as expected. 

## Bug 5: Gemini API 404 Error with smolagents

### Description
- When running the app, any attempt to generate model output with Gemini results in:
  ```
  Error in generating model output:
  Error code: 404
  ```
- This occurs even though the API key and endpoint are valid (as confirmed by a direct API test).

### Attempts
1. **Tried Multiple Endpoint/Model Combinations:**
   - Used both `v1` and `v1beta` endpoints.
   - Tried model IDs: `gemini-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`, and with/without `:generateContent`.
   - Tried setting the full endpoint in `api_base` and leaving `model_id` blank.
2. **Direct API Test:**
   - Created a standalone script using `requests` to POST to the Gemini endpoint with the same API key and payload.
   - The direct test returned status 200 and a valid response, confirming the key and endpoint are correct.
3. **Matched Direct Call in smolagents:**
   - Updated `OpenAIServerModel` config to use the exact endpoint and model as the working direct test.
   - Still received a 404 error from the app, even though the direct test worked.

### Current Status
- The 404 error persists when using `OpenAIServerModel` in smolagents, but not when calling the Gemini API directly.
- This suggests that smolagents' OpenAI-compatible model wrapper is not compatible with Gemini's endpoint structure or payload format.

### Next Steps
- Investigate smolagents documentation/source for Gemini-specific support or configuration.
- Consider writing a custom Gemini model wrapper that mimics the direct API call.
- Optionally, contact smolagents maintainers for guidance or feature support.

## Bug 6: CodeAgent Tool Access Framework Issue - RESOLVED ✅

### Description
- The CodeAgent was experiencing an internal smolagents framework issue where it couldn't properly access custom tools
- Error: `'GeocodingTool' object has no attribute 'is_initialized'`
- Tools were being registered correctly but the framework was failing during tool execution
- Specifically affected geocoding and subway proximity tools when chained together

### Symptoms
1. **Tool Registration Working**: Tools showed up in agent.tools list (5 tools counted)
2. **Simple Tools Working**: `final_answer` tool worked fine
3. **Complex Tool Calls Failing**: Geocoding and subway tools failed with AttributeError
4. **Tools Work Independently**: Direct tool calls outside agent worked perfectly
5. **Framework Conversion**: Tools were converted to name strings in agent context

### Investigation Process
1. **Verified Tool Implementation**: All tools properly inherited from smolagents.Tool
2. **Checked Tool Attributes**: All required attributes (name, description, inputs, output_type, forward) present
3. **Tested Direct Tool Calls**: Confirmed tools work independently:
   ```python
   geocode_result = geocoding_tool.forward('Grand Avenue, Bronx, NY 10468')
   # ✅ Success: (40.8662227, -73.9006796)
   
   subway_result = nearest_subway_tool.forward(lat=40.8662227, lon=-73.9006796) 
   # ✅ Success: Kingsbridge Rd (4 train) - 0.2 miles
   ```
4. **Identified Framework Issue**: smolagents CodeAgent expecting `is_initialized` attribute

### Root Cause
The smolagents framework internally checks for an `is_initialized` attribute on Tool objects during execution, but this wasn't documented in the Tool interface. Our custom tools inherited from Tool but didn't have this expected attribute.

### Failed Attempts
1. **Expanded Authorized Imports**: Added missing imports like `time`, `datetime`, `typing`, etc.
   - Didn't resolve the core issue
2. **Tool Validation**: Created validation functions to check tool attributes
   - All tools passed validation but still failed in agent context

### Successful Fix ✅
**Root Solution**: Added missing smolagents framework requirements to all custom tools:

1. **Added `super().__init__()` calls** to properly initialize Tool base class:
   ```python
   def __init__(self):
       super().__init__()  # ← Added this to properly initialize Tool base class
       # ... existing initialization
   ```

2. **Added Missing Framework Attribute**:
```python
def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    # ... existing setup ...
    self.is_initialized = True  # ← Added this expected attribute
```

**3. Files Modified**:
- ✅ `nearest_subway_tool.py` - Added `super().__init__()` and `is_initialized = True`
- ✅ `geocoding_tool.py` - Added `super().__init__()` and `is_initialized = True`  
- ✅ `enrichment_tool.py` - Added `super().__init__()` and `is_initialized = True`
- ✅ `violation_checker_agent.py` - Added `super().__init__()` and `is_initialized = True`
- ✅ `browser_agent.py` - Already had proper initialization
- ✅ `agent_setup.py` - Expanded authorized imports for tool compatibility

#### Testing Results

**Before Fix**:
```
❌ AttributeError: 'GeocodingTool' object has no attribute 'is_initialized'
❌ Tools work individually but fail in agent context
❌ No subway proximity information available to users
```

**After Fix** ✅:
```

## 🏠 MAJOR UPDATE: ADDRESS EXTRACTION ENHANCEMENT (June 2024)

### **Feature: Enhanced Address Extraction from Craigslist Listings**

#### **Problem Identified:**
VoucherBot was displaying listing titles (e.g., "$2,500 Hasa Approved. Studio. New New New (Bronx)") in the address field instead of actual addresses. This made it impossible for violation checking, subway tools, and geocoding services to function properly.

**Example Issue:**
- **Expected**: "East 184, Bronx, NY 10458" 
- **Actual**: "$2,500 Hasa Approved. Studio. New New New (Bronx)"

#### **Root Cause Analysis:**
The browser agent's JavaScript extraction script wasn't capturing address information from Craigslist listing pages. The address field was empty, causing `app.py` to fall back to using the listing title via:
```python
address = listing.get("address") or listing.get("title", "N/A")
```

### **Attempted Fixes:**

#### **Attempt 1: Basic Address Element Detection**
- **Approach**: Added simple `.mapaddress` selector to JavaScript extraction
- **Result**: Found some addresses but validation was too strict
- **Issue**: Many valid addresses like "Nelson Ave near East 181st" were rejected

#### **Attempt 2: Enhanced Validation Patterns**
- **Approach**: Improved address validation with NYC-specific patterns
- **Result**: Better detection but still missing normalization
- **Issue**: Addresses lacked proper formatting and borough context

### **Final Implementation: Comprehensive Address Extraction System**

#### **1. Multi-Strategy JavaScript Extraction**
Enhanced the extraction script with 4 different address detection strategies:

```javascript
// Strategy 1: Map address elements (most reliable)
let mapAddress = document.querySelector('.mapaddress') ||
               document.querySelector('[class*="map-address"]')

// Strategy 2: Address in posting title parentheses  
let addressMatch = titleText.match(/[\(\$\-]\s*([^\(\$]+(?:Bronx|Brooklyn|Manhattan|Queens|Staten Island)[^\)]*)/i)

// Strategy 3: Address in attributes sections
let attrGroups = document.querySelectorAll('.attrgroup')

// Strategy 4: Address patterns in description text
let addressPatterns = [
    /([0-9]+\s+[A-Za-z\s]+(?:Street|St|Avenue|Ave|Road|Rd)...*(?:Bronx|Brooklyn|Manhattan|Queens|Staten Island).*NY.*[0-9]{5}?)/gi,
    /((?:East|West|North|South)?\s*[0-9]+[A-Za-z]*\s*(?:Street|St|Avenue|Ave|Road|Rd).*(?:Bronx|Brooklyn|Manhattan|Queens))/gi
]
```

#### **2. Flexible Address Validation**
Replaced strict validation with flexible criteria:

```python
def _validate_address(address: str) -> bool:
    # Accept street-like patterns
    street_patterns = [
        r'(?:street|st|avenue|ave|road|rd|boulevard|blvd)',
        r'(?:east|west|north|south)\s+\d+',  # East 184th, West 42nd
        r'near\s+(?:east|west|north|south)',  # "near East 181st"
    ]
    
    # Accept NYC indicators
    nyc_indicators = ['bronx', 'brooklyn', 'manhattan', 'queens', 'harlem', 'parkchester']
    
    # Reject bad patterns
    bad_patterns = [r'^\$\d+', r'br\s*-\s*\d+ft', r'🏙️.*housing']
```

#### **3. Smart Address Normalization**
Added borough context and standardized formatting:

```python
def _normalize_address(address: str, borough_context: str = None) -> str:
    # Add borough context if missing
    if borough_context and not any(borough.lower() in address.lower() for borough in ['bronx', 'brooklyn']):
        address = f"{address}, {borough_context.title()}"
    
    # Ensure NY state is included
    if 'NY' not in address.upper():
        address += ', NY'
    
    return address.strip()
```

#### **4. Comprehensive Debugging System**
Added detailed logging to understand extraction patterns:

```python
# Log debug information for each extraction attempt
if result.get('debug'):
    print(f"🔍 DEBUG for {url}:")
    for attempt in result['debug'].get('attempts', []):
        print(f"   Strategy {attempt['strategy']}: {attempt}")
```

### **Implementation Files Modified:**

#### **1. `browser_agent.py` 🔧 MAJOR UPDATES**
- **Enhanced JavaScript extraction**: 4-strategy address detection
- **Flexible validation**: `_validate_address()` with NYC-specific patterns  
- **Smart normalization**: `_normalize_address()` with borough context
- **Performance optimizations**: LRU caching and improved error handling
- **Comprehensive debugging**: Detailed extraction attempt logging

#### **2. New Functions Added:**
```python
_validate_address(address: str) -> bool                    # Flexible address validation
_normalize_address(address: str, borough_context: str)     # Smart formatting  
_get_detailed_data_with_enhanced_address(url: str)         # Multi-strategy extraction
_process_listings_batch_with_addresses(...)               # Enhanced batch processing
collect_voucher_listings_with_addresses(...)              # Address-aware collection
save_to_json_with_address_metrics(...)                    # Performance tracking
test_address_enhanced_browser_agent()                     # Comprehensive testing
```

### Bug 10: NearSchoolTool Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

#### Description
User requested creation of a NearSchoolTool similar to the existing nearest subway tool, but for finding nearby NYC public schools. Requirements included:
- Use NYC Open Data API endpoint (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/wg9x-4ke6.json)
- Include walking distance calculations
- Implement caching performance like the subway tool
- Always show the 3 nearest schools to users
- Add filtering for specific school types (elementary, middle/junior, high school)

#### Implementation Phase 1: Basic NearSchoolTool

**Core Features Implemented**:
- ✅ NYC Open Data Schools API integration with proper query parameters
- ✅ Geodesic distance calculations with haversine fallback
- ✅ Intelligent two-level caching (API data cache: 12 hours, results cache: 24 hours)
- ✅ Walking time estimates (3 mph average speed)
- ✅ Thread-safe operations with background cache cleanup
- ✅ Returns top 3 nearest schools with comprehensive information

**Key Technical Details**:
```python
# API Integration
url = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/wg9x-4ke6.json"
params = {
    "status_descriptions": "Open",  # Filter for open schools only
    "$limit": 2000,
    "$order": "school_name"
}

# Distance Calculation
try:
    distance_km = geodesic((lat, lon), (school_lat, school_lon)).kilometers
except Exception:
    distance_km = self._haversine_distance(lat, lon, school_lat, school_lon)

# Walking Time Estimation  
walking_time_minutes = distance_km / 4.828  # 3 mph average walking speed
```

**Data Quality Features**:
- ✅ Validates NYC coordinate bounds (40.4-40.9 lat, -74.3 to -73.7 lon)
- ✅ Cleans up grade formatting (e.g., "PK-05" instead of comma-separated)
- ✅ Includes school type, address, coordinates, and walking times
- ✅ Filters for open schools only using `status_descriptions='Open'`

#### Testing Phase 1: Basic Functionality

**Created `test_near_school_tool.py`** with comprehensive tests:
- ✅ Basic functionality across all 5 NYC boroughs
- ✅ Cache performance testing (showed 1.7x speed improvement)
- ✅ Error handling for invalid inputs and coordinates outside NYC
- ✅ Walking time calculation verification
- ✅ Performance benchmarks (average 0.03s per query after caching)

**Test Results**:
```
✅ 1896 active schools loaded from API
✅ All 5 test locations returned 3 schools each
✅ Cache hit ratio of 37.5% during testing
✅ Proper walking time calculations verified
✅ Performance: 0.03s average response time with caching
```

#### Integration Phase 1: System Integration

**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `tools.py` - Imported the new school tool
- ✅ Created `test_school_integration.py` - Workflow integration with geocoding
- ✅ Demonstrated enriching housing listings with school data
- ✅ Calculated school quality scores based on proximity and variety

#### Enhancement Phase 2: Advanced Filtering

**New Filtering System**:
```python
def forward(self, lat: float, lon: float, school_type: str = 'all') -> str:
    # school_type options: 'elementary', 'middle', 'high', 'all'
    
def _filter_schools_by_type(self, schools: List[Dict], school_type: str) -> List[Dict]:
    if school_type == 'all':
        return schools
    
    type_keywords = {
        'elementary': ['elementary', 'primary', 'pk', 'kindergarten', 'early childhood'],
        'middle': ['middle', 'intermediate', 'junior', 'ms ', 'is '],  
        'high': ['high', 'secondary', 'hs ', 'academy', 'preparatory']
    }
```

**Enhanced User Experience**:
- ✅ Added `school_type` parameter with options: 'elementary', 'middle', 'high', 'all'
- ✅ Type-specific caching for performance
- ✅ User-friendly summaries and recommendations
- ✅ Helpful messages when no schools of a type are found
- ✅ Backwards compatibility (defaults to 'all')

#### Integration Phase 2: Enhanced Enrichment

**Updated `enrichment_tool.py`**:
- ✅ Added school information alongside building violations and subway data
- ✅ Implemented school scoring (0-100 based on distance and variety)
- ✅ Updated overall scoring: 50% safety, 30% transit, 20% school access

**Scoring Algorithm**:
```python
def _calculate_school_score(school_distances: List[float]) -> int:
    if not school_distances:
        return 0
    
    avg_distance = sum(school_distances) / len(school_distances)
    variety_bonus = min(10, len(school_distances) * 3)  # Up to 10 points for variety
    
    if avg_distance <= 0.3:      # Within 0.3 miles
        base_score = 100
    elif avg_distance <= 0.5:    # Within 0.5 miles  
        base_score = 80
    elif avg_distance <= 1.0:    # Within 1 mile
        base_score = 60
    else:
        base_score = max(20, 80 - int((avg_distance - 1.0) * 20))
    
    return min(100, base_score + variety_bonus)
```

# Debugging Notes

## Material Design Expand/Collapse Arrow Bug (July 2024)

### Issue Description
After implementing Material Design styling, the expand/collapse arrows in the chat interface were replaced with teal-colored square blocks. The blocks were functional (clicking would expand/collapse sections) but were visually inconsistent with the desired UI.

### Symptoms
1. Teal square blocks instead of arrows
2. Blocks appeared where expand/collapse indicators should be
3. Clicking the blocks still triggered expand/collapse functionality
4. Element inspection showed the blocks were related to SVG circle elements

### Initial Investigation
- Console errors showed font loading issues and manifest.json 404s
- Element inspection revealed the teal blocks were actually SVG circles in the dropdown arrow component
- Structure identified:
```html
<button class="svelte-vzs2gq padded">
  <div class="svelte-vzs2gq small">
    <svg class="dropdown-arrow svelte-1m886t3">
      <circle cx="9" cy="9" r="8" class="circle"></circle>
      <path d="M5 8l4 4 4-4z"></path>
    </svg>
  </div>
</button>
```

### Debug Attempts

1. First Attempt - CSS Override
- Tried to hide circle and style arrow
- Result: Partial success - removed teal blocks but lost arrows completely

2. Second Attempt - Button Removal
- Completely removed the button element
- Result: Lost all expand/collapse functionality

3. Final Solution - Comprehensive SVG Styling
```css
/* Style the expand/collapse arrow */
button.svelte-vzs2gq.padded {
    background: transparent !important;
    border: none !important;
    padding: 4px !important;
    cursor: pointer !important;
    width: 24px !important;
    height: 24px !important;
    display: inline-flex !important;
    align-items: center !important;
    justify-content: center !important;
}

.dropdown-arrow {
    width: 18px !important;
    height: 18px !important;
    display: block !important;
}

/* Hide only the circle background */
.dropdown-arrow .circle {
    fill: transparent !important;
    stroke: none !important;
}

/* Style the arrow path */
.dropdown-arrow path {
    fill: #666 !important;
    transform-origin: center !important;
}
```

### Resolution
- Made circle transparent instead of removing it
- Properly sized and positioned the button and SVG
- Maintained expand/collapse functionality
- Kept clean Material Design aesthetic
- Arrow visible and properly styled in neutral gray

### Key Learnings
1. SVG styling requires careful consideration of all elements (circle and path)
2. Using `display: none` can break functionality - better to use `transparent` for backgrounds
3. Proper sizing and flexbox alignment ensures consistent appearance
4. Important to maintain both visual elements and functionality when fixing UI issues
